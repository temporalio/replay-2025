      This Code of Conduct may be revised at any time by Temporal, and the terms are non-negotiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temporal is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants on all our
      platforms and events, whether they are held virtually or in person.
    </p>
    <h2 id="participants-contributors-and-temporal-staff">
      Participants, Contributors, and Temporal Staff
    </h2>
    <p>
      As participants, contributors, and Temporal staff, in the interest of fostering an open and
      welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues,
      posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, asking
      questions on our support platforms, and other activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are committed to making participation in Temporal projects a harassment-free experience for
      everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
      orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or
      nationality.
    </p>
    <p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery</li>
      <li>Personal attacks</li>
      <li>Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments</li>
      <li>Public or private harassment</li>
      <li>
        Publishing others‚Äô private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without
        explicit permission
      </li>
      <li>Other unethical or unprofessional conduct</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Temporal staff have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits,
      code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of
      Conduct. By adopting this Code of Conduct, Temporal staff commit themselves to fairly and
      consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project.
    </p>
    <p>
      This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an
      individual is representing the project or its community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior in Temporal may be
      reported by contacting us via <a href="mailto:conduct@temporal.io">conduct@temporal.io</a> or using
      the Harassment Complaint Form button at the top of this page.

    <h2 id="online-discussion">Online Discussion</h2>
    <h3 id="civilized-place-for-public-discussion">Civilized Place for Public Discussion</h3>
    <p>
      Please treat our discussion forums with the same respect you would a public park. It is a
      shared community resource ‚Äî a place to share skills, knowledge, and interests through ongoing
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are not hard and fast rules‚Äîthey are guidelines to aid the human judgment of our
      community and keep this a clean and well-lit place for civilized public discourse.
    </p>
    <h3 id="improve-the-discussion">Improve the Discussion</h3>
    <p>
      Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in
      some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over
      what you want to say and try again later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too.
      Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of
      what is being said.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way to improve the discussion is by discovering discussions that are already happening.
      Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you‚Äôll have a
      better chance of meeting others who share your interests.
    </p>
    <h3 id="be-agreeable-even-when-you-disagree">Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree</h3>
    <p>
      You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That‚Äôs fine. But remember to
      criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name-calling</li>
      <li>Ad hominem attacks</li>
      <li>Responding to a post‚Äôs tone instead of its actual content</li>
      <li>Knee-jerk contradiction</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instead, provide reasoned counterarguments that improve the conversation.</p>
    <h3 id="your-participation-counts">Your Participation Counts</h3>
    <p>
      The conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the
      future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an
      interesting place to be ‚Äî and avoiding those that do not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and
      worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, and so forth. Use these tools
      to improve your own experience, and everyone else‚Äôs, too.
    </p>
    <p>Let‚Äôs leave our community better than we found it.</p>
    <h3 id="if-you-see-a-problem-flag-it">If You See a Problem, Flag It</h3>
    <p>
      Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for the forums. But so are you. With
      your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you see bad behavior, don‚Äôt reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it,
      consumes your energy, and wastes everyone‚Äôs time. Just flag it. If enough flags accrue, action
      will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any
      user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts; the moderators
      and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.
    </p>
    <h3 id="always-be-civil">Always Be Civil</h3>
    <p>Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Be civil. Don‚Äôt post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or
        hate speech.
      </li>
      <li>Keep it clean. Don‚Äôt post anything obscene or sexually explicit.</li>
      <li>
        Respect each other. Don‚Äôt harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their
        private information.
      </li>
      <li>Respect our forum. Don‚Äôt post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are not concrete terms with precise definitions ‚Äî avoid even the appearance of any of
      these things. If you‚Äôre unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on
      the front page of the New York Times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our discussion forums are public. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and
      friends.
    </p>
    <h3 id="keep-it-tidy">Keep It Tidy</h3>
    <p>
      Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing
      and less cleaning up. So:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don‚Äôt start a topic in the wrong category.</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt post no-content replies.</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt divert a topic by changing it midstream.</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt sign your posts ‚Äî every post has your profile information attached to it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Rather than posting ‚Äú+1‚Äù or ‚ÄúAgreed‚Äù, use the Like button or üëç reaction. Rather than taking
      an existing topic in a radically different direction:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discourse: use Reply as a Linked Topic.</li>
      <li>Slack: post a new thread with a link to the existing thread.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="post-only-your-own-stuff">Post Only Your Own Stuff</h3>
    <p>
      You may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not
      post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone‚Äôs intellectual property
      (software, video, audio, images) or breaking any other law.
    </p>
    <h3 id="powered-by-you">Powered by You</h3>
    <p>
      Discourse is operated by your friendly local staff and you, the community. If you have any
      further questions about how things should work, open a new topic in the site feedback category
      and let‚Äôs discuss! If there‚Äôs a critical or urgent issue that can‚Äôt be handled by a meta topic
      or flag, contact us via the staff page.
    </p>
    <h3 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, legalese is boring, but we must protect ourselves ‚Äî and by extension, you and your data ‚Äî
      against unfriendly folks. We have a Terms of Service describing your (and our) behavior and
      rights related to content, privacy, and laws. To use this service, you must agree to abide by
      our TOS.
    </p>
    <h2 id="temporal-events">Temporal Events</h2>
    <p>
      Temporal is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at all of our
      events, whether they are held in person or virtually. Temporal events exist to encourage the
      open exchange of ideas and expression and require an environment that recognizes the inherent
      worth of every person and group. While at Temporal events or related ancillary or social
      events, any participants, including members, speakers, attendees, volunteers, sponsors, and
      anyone else, should not engage in harassment in any form.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Code of Conduct may be revised at any time by Temporal and the terms are non-negotiable.
      Your registration for or attendance at any Temporal event, whether it‚Äôs held in person or
      virtually, indicates your agreement to abide by this policy and its terms.
    </p>
    <h3 id="expected-behavior">Expected Behavior</h3>
    <p>
      All event participants, whether they are attending an in-person event or a virtual event, are
      expected to behave in accordance with professional standards, with both this Code of Conduct
      as well as their respective employer‚Äôs policies governing appropriate workplace behavior and
      applicable laws.
    </p>
    <h3 id="unaccepted-behavior">Unaccepted Behavior</h3>
    <p>
      Harassment will not be tolerated in any form, whether in person or virtually, including, but
      not limited to, harassment based on gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
      orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or any other
      status protected by laws in which the conference or program is being held. Harassment includes
      the use of abusive, offensive or degrading language, intimidation, stalking, harassing
      photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, sexual imagery and unwelcome sexual
      advances or requests for sexual favors. Any report of harassment at one of our events, whether
      in person or virtual, will be addressed immediately. Participants asked to stop any harassing
      behavior are expected to comply immediately. Anyone who witnesses or is subjected to
      unacceptable behavior should notify Temporal at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Individuals who participate (or plan to participate) in Temporal events, whether its an
      in-person event or a virtual event, should conduct themselves at all times in a manner that
      comports with both the letter and spirit of this policy prohibiting harassment and abusive
      behavior, whether before, during or after the event. This includes statements made in social
      media postings, on-line publications, text messages, and all other forms of electronic
      communication.
    </p>
    <h3 id="consequences-of-unaccepted-behavior">Consequences of Unaccepted Behavior</h3>
    <p>
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, whether in person or virtually, the event
      organizers may take any action they deem appropriate depending on the circumstances, ranging
      from issuance of a warning to the offending individual to expulsion from the conference with
      no refund. Temporal reserves the right to exclude any participant found to be engaging in
      harassing behavior from participating in any further Temporal events, trainings or other
      activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a participant (or individual wishing to participate in a Temporal event, in-person and/or
      virtual), through postings on social media or other online publications or another form of
      electronic communication, engages in conduct that violates this policy, whether before, during
      or after a Temporal event, Temporal may take appropriate corrective action, which could
      include imposing a temporary or permanent ban on an individual‚Äôs participation in future
      Temporal events.
    </p>
    <h3 id="what">What</h3>
    <p>To Do If You Witness or Are Subject to Unaccepted Behavior</p>
    <p>
      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
      concerns relating to harassment, please contact Temporal immediately at <a
        href="mailto:conduct@temporal.io">conduct@temporal.io</a
